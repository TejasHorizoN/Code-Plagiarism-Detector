## üö¶ How It Works

TwinCode uses advanced fingerprinting technology:
- **Tokenization:** Breaks code into tokens.
- **K-gram Analysis:** Creates overlapping token sequences.
- **Winnowing Algorithm:** Selects representative fingerprints.
- **Similarity Scoring:** Calculates percentage overlap between files.

**Supported Formats:**  
Common source code files (`.py`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.java`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.php`, `.rb`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.txt`, etc.)

**Performance:**  
Optimized for fast analysis of large codebases with efficient memory usage.
